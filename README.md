Instead of regular items, this add-on lets your spawners/generators spawn literal exp orbs! Players earn level from every earned orb, with which they may buy items from the shop and upgrade shop.
You don’t have to replace all spawners with exp orbs – you may as well keep your existing ones and e.g. have a special event for certain items. Or replace them all. You are free to customize it however you like.
